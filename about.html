        <h2 class="section-title">About Me:</h2>
        <p class="section-text">I originally became interested in the Tech industry when I started my Certificate III of IT at TasTAFE in Tasmania.</p>
        <p class="section-text">While studying the certificate, I was particularly interested in the programming clusters of the course.</p>
        <p class="section-text">I learned how to use 'HTML' and 'CSS' to create webpages, and I also made an application lodging portal app using 'Python'.</p>
        <p class="section-text">I continued self-studying using resources like 'FreeCodeCamp' and 'The Odin Project' to further my coding skills, and I uploaded my projects to <a href="https://github.com/wagonwheels40">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p class="section-text">I have also recently completed my CompTIA A+ certificate.</p>
