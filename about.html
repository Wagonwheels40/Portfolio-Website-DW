      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p class="section-text">I have worked in various industries in the past, with my most recent role being at 'Statewide Independent Wholesalers' in Tasmania where I worked in a distribution warehouse for two and ½ years. While I enjoyed the job, it was physically demanding and not something I could see myself doing in the long term. This led me to explore other opportunities, and so I decided to enroll in a Certificate III of IT at TasTAFE.</p>
      <p class="section-text">While studying the course, I found myself drawn to the programming cluster, and I spent hours each day working on improving my skills through online resources like 'freecodecamp' and 'sololearn'. As I gained more experience, I started working on projects. Throughout this process, I learned how to create websites and apps by using ‘HTML’, ‘CSS’, ‘Javascript’, and became familiar with library frameworks such as ‘Bootstrap’, ‘jQuery’ and ‘React’. I have also made my own sports analysis apps using 'Python'.</p>
      <p class="section-text">My interest in the design aspect of building websites through 'HTML' and 'CSS' led me to pursue a career as a front-end developer. I have created a 'Github' page to showcase my projects, and I plan to continue expanding my knowledge and skill set.</p>
      <p class="section-text">Currently, I have been learning coding for approximately seven months, and I am still as eager to work on small projects and learn more every day as I was when I first started my IT course. Please refer to the 'Coding Work' tab to see some of the projects I have displayed and there will also be a link to my ‘GitHub’ page. I would love the opportunity to showcase my skills and contribute to your company.</p>
      <p class="section-text">Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me here.</p>
